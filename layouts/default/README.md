# Default Layout Examples

Glove80 ships several stock layouts curated by MoErgo.
The `layouts/default` directory tracks the JSON artifacts exported from the layout editor so they can be referenced alongside TailorKey and QuantumTouch.

These JSON files are mirrored in the Python sources under `src/glove80/layout_families/default`, where each layout is described as declarative layer specs similar to TailorKey and QuantumTouch.
Keeping them under version control ensures we can diff against MoErgo’s published versions while treating the code-driven specs as the source of truth.
