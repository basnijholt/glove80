Hey folks! Long-time Glove80 user here who’s been missing a truly open layout editor.

Right now we have two awesome, battle-tested browser editors: the awesome official MoErgo editor at https://my.glove80.com/ and Nick Coutsos’s open web editor at https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/. They both have years of polish behind them and I don’t want to compete with that hard-won work.

Instead, I’m considering building a fully open-source **terminal** editor (Textual TUI + CLI integration, schema validation, regen hooks) with a strong programmable angle—think the ability to embed Python code to generate or transform layouts directly.

My goal is to also allow it to export a Glove80-compatible JSON layout file, so users can still leverage the existing web editor(s).

Before diving in, I’d love to gauge interest:
- Would you use an open editor that round-trips the Glove80 JSON payloads?
- Which features matter most? (Layer editing, hold-tap/macro builders, device-tree tweaks, custom behaviors, etc.)
- Anyone interested in collaborating or testing?

If there’s enthusiasm I’ll share a roadmap and start prototyping. Reactions and replies welcome—thanks! ✌️
