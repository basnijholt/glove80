# Glove80 Layout Toolkit

This repository is the canonical, code-first source of the Glove80 layout families ([Default](layouts/default/README.md), [TailorKey](layouts/tailorkey/README.md), [QuantumTouch](layouts/quantum_touch/README.md), and [Glorious Engrammer](layouts/glorious-engrammer/README.md)).
Every release JSON under `layouts/*/releases` can be regenerated deterministically from the declarative specs and metadata checked into `src/glove80`.

**Why this exists:** TailorKey (and now QuantumTouch, Glorious Engrammer, etc.) used to be kept in sync by hand in the layout editor, which made even trivial tweaks error-prone and slow to propagate across Windows/macOS/Dual/Bilateral variants. By expressing every layer, macro, combo, and alpha layout in Python, we get reproducible builds, automated regression tests, and the ability to spin up new variants (Colemak, Colemak-DH, Dvorak, custom mixes) by reusing the same building blocks instead of copying JSON around. You can still download the generated JSON into the editor for visualization, but the code here is the single source of truth that guarantees consistency.

## Highlights
- The default, TailorKey, QuantumTouch, and Glorious Engrammer families live under `src/glove80/families/` with typed specs, factories, and regression tests.
- Metadata travels with the package (`src/glove80/families/*/metadata.json`), so the CLI and library always agree on UUIDs, release notes, and output paths.
- A Typer-powered CLI (`glove80 generate …`) replaces ad-hoc scripts and keeps the regeneration workflow uniform across layouts.
- Release artifacts are grouped under `layouts/<layout>/releases`, keeping the repo root clean while preserving the published JSON verbatim.
- Reusable "feature" helpers under `glove80.features` (e.g., `bilateral_home_row_components`) bundle macros plus ready-made layers so you can drop complex behaviors into custom layouts without spelunking through family internals.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies (the repo uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
2. Regenerate every release JSON:
   ```bash
   just regen
   ```
3. Run the full regression suite (per-layer tests + layout parity checks):
   ```bash
   just ci
   ```
4. Need a single variant? Use the CLI directly:
   ```bash
   glove80 generate --layout tailorkey --variant mac
   ```

`just --list` shows the available helper tasks.

## Using the Python API
The public API lives on the root package:

```python
from glove80 import (
    build_layout,
    list_families,
    apply_feature,
    bilateral_home_row_components,
)

print(list_families())  # ['default', 'tailorkey', 'quantum_touch', 'glorious_engrammer']
layout = build_layout("tailorkey", "mac")
components = bilateral_home_row_components("mac")
apply_feature(layout, components)
```

`build_layout(<family>, <variant>)` returns the same dictionary that the CLI writes into `layouts/<family>/releases/…`.

### Minimal Example (<10 lines)
```python
from glove80 import build_layout, apply_feature, bilateral_home_row_components

layout = build_layout("tailorkey", "windows")
apply_feature(layout, bilateral_home_row_components("windows"))
# now `layout` contains the merged macros/layers and can be serialized
```

### CLI Tips
- Validate any layout JSON: `glove80 validate path/to.json`
- Override output destination: `glove80 generate --layout tailorkey --variant windows --out /tmp/out.json`
- Families list: `glove80 families`

Notes:
- The CLI accepts `glorious-engrammer` as an alias for `glorious_engrammer`.

- Read `docs/architecture.md` for a walkthrough of the data flow and regeneration pipeline.
- `layouts/default/README.md`, `layouts/tailorkey/README.md`, `layouts/quantum_touch/README.md`, and `layouts/glorious-engrammer/README.md` explain how each layout family is structured, the available layers, and the steps for adding new variants.

## CI Contract
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same steps you do locally:
- `just regen` must leave `layouts/*/releases` unchanged or the build fails, proving the checked-in JSON matches the current code.
- `just ci` (`uv run pytest`) covers every layer factory plus whole-layout comparisons.
- Pull requests are required to keep both commands clean, so regeneration plus tests are the only gatekeepers.

## Contributing
1. Edit specs or metadata, re-run `just regen`, and inspect the resulting diffs under `layouts/`.
2. Extend/adjust the targeted per-layer tests under `tests/<layout>/` when you change behavior.
3. Document intentional changes in the relevant `layouts/<family>/README.md` (and `docs/architecture.md` if the pipeline changes) so future contributors understand the rationale.
